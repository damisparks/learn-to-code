					<b>Better</b> 
					<em>
					 according to researches, and dictionary meaning means something, <br> person or whatever it is of a higher standard, more suitable or effective when it is better compared to other things or people. <br> However this makes a lot of sense i think!!!
					</em>
				</p>
				<p class="text-align-center">
				But come to think of it, What is really better ?
				</p>

					<p class="text-align-center">
				<em>
					To me, i like to see it this way, <strong>Better</strong> is when you feel you can do more of something,<br>
			    you are okay with where you are but think there is more things to be done. <br> Looking for a way to do
				  thing better (innovation) or try something new or taking on new challenges.</em>
				<em> 
					I happen to think there is no way for my development if i do not taking on, on something difficult. <br>
				 I feel i learn a lot in the process of it though. <br> "Remember" What does not kill you makes you
				 stronger, <br> and who says Better is going to be easy either.
				 	<br> So when you see soemthing next time and you do not go for
					 ? then the question is do you want ?
